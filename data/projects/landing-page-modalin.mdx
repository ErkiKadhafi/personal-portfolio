> ## Project Purpose

The purpose of this website is to promotes all clients about new products. The site
is connected with main site.

> ## About This Project

In this project, It's quite simple in terms of the site complexity that only
consists of some pages and some forms but I learn a lot in team work. 
During my internship, I am the only intern so all my partners are the workers there. 

I learn about **SCRUM**, learn how to read other person's code, 
project management tools like **Jira**, and also one of the tools in Git which is **Source Git**. 
In this internship, I also learnt about how the project is structured
in **Git Flow**, which is a good knowledge for managing my projects in the future.
