Whenever I work with Firebase, I always seem to run into small issues
that can be very annoying (yet simple) to solve. When I tried to connect
my Flutter application to a Firebase backend for one of my personal projects,
I ran into some small issues that set me back some time. Because of this,

connect your Flutter application to a firebase backend for both IOS and Android.
After this tutorial, you will be all set to add authentication, cloud Firestore,
or any other Firebase feature you might want.
