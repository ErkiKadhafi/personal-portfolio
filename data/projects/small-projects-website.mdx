## Project Purpose

The purpose of this website is to display all my small projects.


## About This Project

This site was originally built for my personal portfolio. It contains all my 
small projects that I built trough my journey on learning web development.
The projects are consisted of colleague and bootcamp assignment and also tutorial youtube task.

Some of the projects were built to learn new stuff like **threeJs** (a library
for managing 3D stuff for javascript), animation stuff with Javascript, design cloning,
,fetching API's, and using third party library so we can send email trough our website. 

If you click the projects, you'll redirected to the website demo link.
