> ## About This Project

This is my first project that using Redux in state management. In this
project, I learn about state management concept and how to do it in
best practice.

One thing that I learn is Redux is a powerful tools if it's used
in big projects but for this, I think the redux is not fully optimized.
It was because the API that used in fetching the data is very limited, hence
the site doesn't have many features where the Redux is truly optimized.
