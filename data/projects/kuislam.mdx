> ## Project Purpose

The purpose of this website is for help others to getting to know better about islamic knowledge trough
technology and we finally get an idea to get this done by using quizz app.

> ## About This Project

This is my final project for my assignment fullstack developer bootcamp at **Yaumi Digital Shcool**.
I collaborated with 7 people during development with 3 people from UI/UX team and the rest from Fullstack team.
This project is very difficult to be complete because it contains a live synchronization during question section.
After hours of research we finally found the solution which is using web socket.

Beside of live synchronization challenge, the project it self is already quite difficult. It has a lot
of pages, many relation table in the databases, authorization (for admin and regular users),
and the design of the UI is quite challenging.

It also has
many third library integrations like **excel** document for content management for all the quiz, OAuth with **google**, and
third party web socket from **Laravel Pusher**.
