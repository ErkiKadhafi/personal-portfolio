> ## About This Project

This is my final project assignment at **Sanber Academy** and my first project that using ReactJs and.
During this development, I learnt how to use ReactJs library component and how to use public API.
Using public API, I learn how to handle design error that may be occured.

This API used again and again because this API is used in every final project
in **Sanber Academy**. So error handling is a must, because the API is not perfect
and many trainee in the bootcamp submit false data or even not all data is submitted
that caused broken design in the development. Using placeholder is a must for the design
that may be broken if the data is not correct.

This is a fun project because I am the only one that used **Chakra Ui** (others are using **Ant Design**)
that contains only the library components for design and not functionalities. So in this project,
I learn how to do sorting, searching, and filtering in the client side manually because
the API is not providing all those features.
