## Project Purpose

This project aims to redesign the Hanaka Classic website which is currently unusable, 
to make it not just look better but also to have a better user experience.

## About This Project

This project is a one of final assignment for my college course of Software Analysis and Planning. 
The course itself starts with finding a business' website that can be improved. 
Then we determine the business' requirements based on observation and requirement anaylsis. 
This requirement anaylsis can be used to make Software Requrement Specification and other documents,
which eventually leads to the Hanaka Classic web redesign.
