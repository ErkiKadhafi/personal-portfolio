## Project Purpose

The purpose of this website is to display all my small projects.

## About This Project

This website is like a virtual scrapbook of my journey learning web development.
It's filled with small projects I've worked on, which range from things my classmates and bootcamps asked me to do,
to tasks I learned from YouTube tutorials.

In these projects, I've tried out all sorts of cool stuff. For instance, I've used a special tool
called `ThreeJs` to make 3D things using JavaScript. I've also made things move around on the
screen using JavaScript, copied designs from other websites just for practice, grabbed information
from other websites using APIs, and even figured out how to send emails from our own website using
someone else's tools.

If you click on any of these projects, you'll get to see what they're like by checking out a working
demo of each one.
