## Project Purpose

This website serves as a platform to showcase new product promotions from iGrow known as `LinkAja Modalin`.
While the majority of the content on the site is pre-set and doesn't change, there's a section in the navbar
that displays statistics. These statistics are fetched from an external source using an API. I decided to include
this project in my portfolio because of its visually appealing design and my successful implementation of
its features.

## About This Project

This website marked my inaugural task during my initial internship. While the coding part was relatively
straightforward, the challenge lay in organizing the project structure. The project was developed in the
same directory as the main project, necessitating an effort to maintain consistent coding style.

Throughout this journey, I not only delved into deciphering existing code but also engaged closely with the
UI/UX team. This provided insights into collaborating effectively across different aspects of development.
Furthermore, I gained exposure to new project management tools like `Jira` and version control systems like `Source Git`.

The experience was both enjoyable and enlightening, significantly expanding my knowledge and skills in the process.
