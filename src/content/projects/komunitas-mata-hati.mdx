## Project Purpose

This is the digital home of the "Komunitas Matahati" community, a collective dedicated to promoting equality
for the visually impaired in society. Originally constructed using a `WordPress` template, the existing website
suffered from subpar interface design and limited accessibility. In a bid to amplify their program's impact,
the community has embarked on the journey of rebuilding the website with a strong focus on enhanced accessibility,
aiming to foster greater awareness and engagement.

## About Web Accessibility

Step into the online world of "Komunitas Matahati," where you'll discover the community's news and happenings.
While they use `WordPress` for their blogs, I've been tasked with improving the main website's look and feel.

Learning about web accessibility is new for me. It means making sure that everyone,
including those with challenges, can use the website easily. The current site might not seem special and
doesn't work well with tools like screen readers. But that's the thingâ€”web accessibility is about making
sure everyone can use it.

People who have trouble seeing use tools like screen readers on their phones or computers. We don't need to
add anything special to the website for these tools to work.

> Think of it like building a smooth sidewalk for wheelchairs instead of giving each person their own wheelchair.

I'm following the <StyledLink openNewTab href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG 2.0</StyledLink>
standards, which are the rules everyone agrees on for web accessibility. So, every part of the website
will be easy to use for everyone.

## Features

The website was put together using `NextJs` and `TailwindCSS`, and it gets its information from `WordPress`.
It's pretty neat how `WordPress` acts like a tool to manage the content. To get the data I need,
I use something called `GraphQL`, which is made easy by a plugin in `WordPress` called `WPGraphQL`.
This plugin provides a special spot where I can get all the info I want.

With the help of `GraphQL`, I don't have to do extra work to set up special points to get data like I would
with something called REST API. On the website itself, users can easily search for articles and move from
one page to another to see more articles using `search` and `cursor based pagination` feature.
