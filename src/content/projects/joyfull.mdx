## Project Purpose

JoyFull is a website that offers recommendations for movies and games. You can explore lists of movies
and games along with their descriptions. Additionally, there's a dashboard where you can contribute by
suggesting new movie or game recommendations. Although the interface might appear a bit unconventional
due to it being my first React project, I believe it remains an enjoyable and fulfilling project to create.

## About This Project

I created this website as part of my final assignment at <StyledLink openNewTab href="https://sanbercode.com/bootcamp/react-js-web-frontend">Sanber Bootcamp Academy</StyledLink>. 
Its main goal is to display and handle data obtained from a designated API provided by the program. 
The API is shared among fellow participants, which sometimes leads to certain data being unavailable or incomplete.

JoyFull represents my debut encounter with using the React Component Library called `ChakraUI`.
While we had the flexibility to opt for other libraries such as `Ant Design` and `Material UI`,
I found the latter two quite intricate and challenging to adapt to my needs. This decision to use
ChakraUI was influenced by its user-friendly nature and suitability for customization.

The website also incorporates user authentication and authorization via a straightforward registration
and login system. To manage cookies, the bootcamp recommended the `js-cookie` package.

In terms of movie and game management, I tackled the implementation of search and sort functionalities.
This presented a significant initial challenge as I embarked on my journey learning React. Initially, the `ChakraUI`
library lacked a built-in Table Component with these capabilities, so I took it upon myself to create a custom solution.

Despite the learning curve, the project remains a source of enjoyment and learning. It offered valuable
insights into `React` concepts like `state`, its manipulation, as well as API fetching using `Axios`.
While the code might appear a bit unorganized, it effectively serves its intended purpose without any
technical glitches.

## Features

These are the features in this site

- CRUD for Movies and Games: Easily manage the content of movies and games, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries.
- Sorting for Each Movies and Games Table: Arrange movies and games in a specific order for better organization and browsing.
- Pagination for Each Movies and Games Table: Divide extensive lists of movies and games into separate pages, making navigation smoother.
- Searching for Each Movies and Games Table: Quickly locate specific movies and games using a search feature.
- Authentication and Authorization: Implement a system that controls access and permissions, ensuring only authorized users can perform certain actions.
