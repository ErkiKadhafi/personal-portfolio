## Project Purpose

This website was made to give people a clear picture of the company and what they sell.
It's like a digital brochure that tells you about the company's background and values,
and it also shows you all the different things they have for sale. Whether you want to
know more about the company or see what they're selling, this website is here to help you explore and learn.

## About This Project

This website marked my initial venture into Next.js projects. A friend entrusted me with this endeavor,
and together, we formed a team of three individuals. The project's requirements were refreshingly
straightforward: to showcase the company's details, their assortment of products, and to incorporate a contact
form for emailing them.

One notable facet was the company's request for a bilingual feature, which was a novel challenge for me.
To achieve this, we employed `React Context` and designed a constant variable containing both languages for
seamless word translation. This ingenious approach also ensured that future developers could effortlessly
modify the information by adjusting the variable's contents.

Our journey also led us to embrace the recently introduced `React Component Library` Chakra UI. Its user-friendly
nature, especially for beginners like us, played a pivotal role in our selection. The project itself was a joyful
experience, and it brought about our inaugural compensation for our collective efforts.

Through this venture, I gained invaluable insights into various aspects. I deepened my understanding of Next.js
and honed my ability to establish project frameworks, delve into server-side rendering through Next.js, and navigate
the intricacies of deploying applications using this framework.

## Features

We integrated several noteworthy features into the website, enhancing its functionality and user experience:

- Dark Mode: Users can toggle between light and dark themes, allowing for comfortable browsing in different environments.
- Dual Language (Bahasa and English): We successfully incorporated a language-switching feature, enabling users to seamlessly switch between Bahasa and English content.
- Smooth Component Animations: Transitions between different sections of the website are embellished with fluid animations, adding a dynamic touch to the browsing experience.
- Interactive Contact Form: A user-friendly contact form was integrated, facilitating easy communication with the company via email. This feature streamlines the process of getting in touch and seeking assistance.
- These additions not only enrich the website's functionality but also contribute to a more engaging and user-centric browsing encounter.
