## Project Purpose

The project's main goal was to develop an engaging platform for learning about Islam.
We aimed to make the learning experience both enjoyable and informative. To achieve this,
we adopted a quiz application approach. Quizzes are not only enjoyable but also encourage friendly
competition with our peers as we tackle the questions. By incorporating Islamic questions into the quizzes,
we've crafted a method to learn about Islamic knowledge in an entertaining manner.

This projects was a final assignment for a full-stack bootcamp at <StyledLink openNewTab href="https://www.instagram.com/yaumidigital.school/">Yaumi Digital School</StyledLink>.
We worked in a team of 10 people, with 3 focusing on design (UI/UX team) and 7 on the technical side (Fullstack Team).
I was the **leader** of the fullstack team.

## About This Project

We had a three-month window to complete the project. This timeframe posed a challenge due to the website's complexity,
involving various components, a considerable number of pages, and some intricate features.

Despite the difficulties, we managed to create the website and it showcased our hard work and dedication.
My role as the technical team leader involved coordinating everyone's work to ensure we finished the project
successfully.

## Features

Kuislam revolves around two core features: the quiz and the question management dashboard. The quiz function
takes inspiration from platforms like `Kahoot`, with a key distinction. While `Kahoot` typically presents questions
on a single shared screen, often via an external monitor, Kuislam delivers questions directly to each user's screen.
This unique approach demands real-time synchronization, ensuring that every user simultaneously accesses the same
question.

This dynamic creates a more intricate implementation process due to the need for seamless question synchronization
across multiple user interfaces.

### Authentication

To initiate a quiz, users need to establish an account. Within this feature, users have the flexibility to
create an account either by providing a username and password manually or by opting for the convenient method
of `Google OAuth`.

### Quiz Room

To kick off the quiz, a user selects a topic from four available options.
Each topic consists of a specific set of questions. Once a user picks a question set, a room is generated,
with that user becoming the host. Every room is assigned a unique code, enabling others to join by entering this code.
This is where `Web Socket` technology comes in, ensuring live synchronization.

`Web Sockets` are integrated into each room, serving as real-time communication channels. Thanks to `Web Sockets`,
rooms stay updated and instantly inform users of any changes. For example, when additional participants enter the room,
the interface automatically updates to show their presence, without the need for page refreshing.
Once all participants are prepared, the quiz can be launched.

### Question Page

Once the host initiates the quiz, all users are seamlessly redirected to the question page.
Each question is allotted its individual timer. During this timeframe, all users must select an answer.
When the timer runs out, everyone is automatically directed to a real-time leaderboard,
displaying the results of the just-answered question.

This process repeats for each question until all have been addressed. Following this, the final leaderboard is
unveiled, showcasing the top 7 users and their points.Implementing this feature was intricate, as it
necessitated ensuring that all users shared the same timer. The entire mechanism relies on `Web Sockets`.
We also took care to prevent potential issues, such as users leaving and rejoining a room mid-question,
as well as handling the conclusion of a room session.

Once the session concludes, users can access their quiz history through an activity page.
This offers a comprehensive overview of quizzes they've participated in.
